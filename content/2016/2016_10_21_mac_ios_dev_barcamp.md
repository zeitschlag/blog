More than one month ago I attended [SwiftConf](https://swiftconf.com) in
Cologne. It was my first developer conference ever and I really enjoyed it.

Earlier this month the [Macoun](https://macoun.de) took place in
Frankfurt, another conference I wanted to attend. Unfortunately I just
came back from the US - I spent two weeks on holiday there - and suffered
from jetlag, so I missed it.

A few days ago Marco Oerter wrote a
[tweet](https://twitter.com/m_oerter/status/784737390099300352), asking
for "interesting conferences in Germany" next to Macoun,
[UIKonf](http://www.uikonf.com) and SwiftConf. Turns out: There are no
other "interesting conferences" in Germany for
iOS/macOS/tvOS/watchOS-devs.

As I'm a [barcamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp) addict - I
really like the atmosphere there, the people are awesome, and the food is
(mostly) great. Did I mention the food? The people? The atmosphere? - I
thought: Hm, why not combine iOS/macOS/watchOS/tvOS-development and
barcamp?

If you don't know, what this barcamp-thingy is (and are too lazy,
to follow the link ;) ): A barcamp is a kind of a special conference. For
those german-speaking folks: [Jan Theofel](https://twitter.com/JanTheofel) explains [the concept in a short
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQBCsBeWFew) much better than I ever
could.

A quick google search revealed, that I'm not the first one who had this
idea. There was already a [Cocoacamp](https://twitter.com/cocoacamp) in
Atlanta, GA back in 2010. But Atlanta, GA is not Berlin, Berlin and 2010
is not 2016. Another mobile-developer-camp is the
[Appdevcamp](http://barcamp-graz.at/information/appdevcamp/) in Graz,
Austria. This camp focuses on app development in general. But, again, this
is not Berlin. In San Jose, there's also the [iOS Dev
Camp](http://www.iosdevcamp.org], which takes place every year since 2007. But again:
This isn't Berlin ;)

So, to make it short: I'd like to organize a
iOS/macOS/watchOS/tvOS-developer-barcamp in Berlin, which should take
place probably in late 2017.

As a founding member of the team, who organizes the [Barcamp Rhein-Neckar
2015 and 2016](https://barcamp.rhein-neckar.me), I know, how much work
organizing a barcamp can be and so I don't like to lift the organization
of the macOS/iOS/watchOS/tvOS-developer-barcamp alone (Maybe we should
call this thing just campOS?).

So what's next? I want you to tell me, what you think about this idea.
Would you attend? Would you like to help organizing it? Would you be a
sponsor? If you say "Yay, #campOS for president!" - at least it isn't
Trump! - "Interesting, tell me more." or "How can I help you?" then leave a comment, send me a [tweet](https://twitter.com/zeitschlag) or an [email](https://encrypt.to/0xFD84809B). I
would organize a table for a meetup, that we can start organizing this
event. So now it's up to you!
