# bullenscheisse.de

This is my personal website/blog. It's called “bullenscheisse", which is a very direct translation of “bullshit“.

The site doesn't use a CMS like wordpress, but is built using [zola](https://getzola.org) — a Static Site Generator. I write my blogposts in Markdown and (mostly) in German.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me via [Email](https://encrypt.to/0xFD84809B), on [Mastodon](http://chaos.social/@zeitschlag/).

Currently, the blog is a bit of a work in progress as I just replaced the Static Site Generator (I moved from `acrylamid` to `Zola`). For now, the blog uses the [Bear](https://www.getzola.org/themes/bearblog/)-theme by Alan Pearce.
