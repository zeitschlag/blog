# bullenscheisse.de

This is my personal website/blog. It's called “bullenscheisse", which is a very direct translation of “bullshit“.

The site doesn't use a CMS like wordpress, but is built using [acrylamid](https://github.com/posativ/acrylamid) — an (unmaintaned) static site/blog generator. I write my blogposts in Markdown and (mostly) in German.
